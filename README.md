# Prerequisites
1. Install Flutter (e.g. `brew install flutter`)
2. Edit `local.properties` file and add the following line: 
    `flutter.sdk=PATH_TO_FLUTTER`

   An example of how the content of the file should look like, with the correct path to `Android` and `Flutter`:
    ```
       ## This file is automatically generated by Android Studio.
       # Do not modify this file -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE ERASED!
       #
       # This file should *NOT* be checked into Version Control Systems,
       # as it contains information specific to your local configuration.
       #
       # Location of the SDK. This is only used by Gradle.
       # For customization when using a Version Control System, please read the
       # header note.
       sdk.dir=/Users/gyuri/Library/Android/sdk
       flutter.sdk=/Users/gyuri/Tools/flutter
    ```



# Gradle Sync Issue 
  You should see the following issue on Gradle Sync: 

```
class org.gradle.api.internal.project.DefaultProject_Decorated cannot be cast to class org.gradle.api.initialization.Settings (org.gradle.api.internal.project.DefaultProject_Decorated and org.gradle.api.initialization.Settings are in unnamed module of loader org.gradle.internal.classloader.VisitableURLClassLoader @72b6cbcc)
class org.gradle.api.internal.project.DefaultProject_Decorated cannot be cast to class org.gradle.api.initialization.Settings (org.gradle.api.internal.project.DefaultProject_Decorated and org.gradle.api.initialization.Settings are in unnamed module of loader org.gradle.internal.classloader.VisitableURLClassLoader @72b6cbcc)

Gradle's dependency cache may be corrupt (this sometimes occurs after a network connection timeout.)

Re-download dependencies and sync project (requires network)
The state of a Gradle build process (daemon) may be corrupt. Stopping all Gradle daemons may solve this problem.

Stop Gradle build processes (requires restart)
Your project may be using a third-party plugin which is not compatible with the other plugins in the project or the version of Gradle requested by the project.

In the case of corrupt Gradle processes, you can also try closing the IDE and then killing all Java processes.
```
